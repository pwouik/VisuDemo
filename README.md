# Currently Working

## Shading

- improve depthmap based shading
    - approximat normal (->PHONG or whatever)
    - SSAO
- Based on fractal
    - store "distance from last jump" in a texture and convert 0-1 to a gradient color (done, I'll try some maprange clamping but doesn't seem to do a big dif)
    - color depending or which attractor it jumped to (bof Ã  priori)

## Optimization

- Currently we're doing : 1 point -> draw 3 points from attractor / keep 1. We could potentially compute 3, compute 9, draw 3+9=12, keep 1 randomly - DONE / ~ -30% fps for 4 times the ammount of point. For some reasons perf difference differ on computer so extensive testing will be requiered
- Lower MAX_FUNC_PER_ATTRACTOR in render_attractor.comp (may be irrelevant but get rid of useless memory in each kernel so may be significant)

### Moving points

Points are only the GPU in an SSBO
Position updated with a compute shader
used to be displayed by concurent writting of pixels on a texture
