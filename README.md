# Currently Working

## Shading

Todo
- fine tune light and pick beatifull âœ¨ðŸŽ¨ colors
- better normal computation (edge cases support for aberrent values)
- leapmotion integration

Maybe ?
- coloring based on which attractor it jumps to (tends to do ugly noise so no)

## Optimization

- Currently we're doing : 1 point -> draw 3 points from attractor / keep 1. We could potentially compute 3, compute 9, draw 3+9=12, keep 1 randomly - DONE / ~ -30% fps for 4 times the ammount of point. For some reasons perf difference differ on computer so extensive testing will be requiered
- Lower MAX_FUNC_PER_ATTRACTOR in render_attractor.comp (may be irrelevant but get rid of useless memory in each kernel so maybe significant) (currently supports up to 10 function per attractor)
- shared memory / tilling in SSAO

## Bugs

- overwrite matrix option kinda not working at some times for *reasons*



# VisuDemo

## Building the app

Download [leap SDK ](https://leap2.ultraleap.com/downloads/) (the Leap Motion Controller, not the 2)
(On windows : if you have issue, consider changeing  `ULTRALEAP_PATH_ROOT` in `CMakeLists.txt` to the path containing `leapsdk-config.cmake` )

in /build/
```cmd
cmake ..
```

```cmd
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Moving points

Points are only the GPU in an SSBO
Position updated with a compute shader
used to be displayed by concurent writting of pixels on a texture



### Shading

#### general Idea

We write on a depthmap in the compute process.
We approximate normals using this depthmap. (It's actually imprecise because it assume sufficient point density so each neigbhor on the texture is close enought)
Then, using those normals, we add :
- a simple phong
- handmades dubious SSAO implementation

#### SSAO

After consideration, actual SSAO as explained in the litterature seemed kinda bs to us (tbh we were too lazy to do the math requiered to sample points inside an half-sphere). So we had 2 approach, both looping over a 9 by 9 grid arround the pixel :
1. accumulate positive depth difference between points and neighbors in the grid. This shouldn't work on paper but for some reasons it looks decent
2. accumulate positive signed distance to tangent plane. The idea is that the bigger, the more occluded a point is (which can be easily understood with a picture). We can get this value with a dot product between the normal and the normalize vector from the point to its neighbor.

Note that this brutforce approach produce a sh\*t ton of of useless computation which should probably be optimized by using some tilling approach and shared memory, but when we have millions points to handle it's actually not that much.

#### race condition when writting on depthmap ?

We simply ignore them.

An issue can occurs if 2 kernels want's to write on the same pixel. However, this is very unlikely.

We choose not to use atomic operation. Thanks to our advanced degree in advanced statistic, we noted that :
- 800x800 texutre => 640 000 pixel
- assuming the point cloud takes 25% of the screen => 160 000 pixel
- assuming we have 2048 kernels on the gpu
- assuming an even repartion of points from cloud to texture

For 1 kernel, the probabily to write on the same pixel than another kernel operating at the same time is : 2047/160000
By some ugly unholy approximation. We say that we have 2048*2047/160000 ~ 26 pixel per 2048 kernel which can conflit (doing the proper math with binomial law is left as an exercise to the reader)
Because in a conflit there's a 50% of the result being correct we divide it by 2.
The 2048 kernels will run until all 20 000 000 points are drawn, so 20 000 000 / 2048  = 1 000 times
With those approximation we get 13 000 pixels having improper depth. This is 8% of the cloud on the texture

Actually that's not accurate, because 8% is only the proportion of issues. But whenever a conflict occurs, it can be overwritten later. So with gross assumption with assume that the proportion of conflict making it out to the final depthmap texture is 160k pixel / 20m ~0.8% of write. So 0.8% of 8% = 0.64% of 160k points.

That's acceptable. We can maybe fixes those numbers in our normal computation (ie detect value to extreme to ignore them, not done yet) or shameless run a blur to fix it.
Well that's assuming atomic is really expensive tbf we didn't really benchmarked it.

We also note that this calcul heavily depends on the number of kernel on the GPU.

All math and assumption aside we can simply observe a decent result.
